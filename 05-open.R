## Open-ended exploration
# What is the most frequent integer that appears in all the sequences combined, excluding the number 1?
# Is there any correlation between the starting integers and the number of odd or even numbers in their sequence?
# What are the most common “stopping times,” i.e., the number of steps it takes for a sequence to first go below its starting integer?
